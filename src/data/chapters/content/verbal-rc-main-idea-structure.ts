# Reading Comprehension: Main Idea & Structure

Reading Comprehension (RC) passages on the GMAT are dense, academic excerpts drawn from business, science, social science, and humanities topics. Unlike Critical Reasoning, where you analyze a short argument, RC requires you to process a passage of 200 to 350 words and answer 3 to 4 questions about it. The two most fundamental question types are **Main Idea** (or Primary Purpose) and **Structure** questions. Mastering these will build the foundation for every other RC question type.

## How to Read RC Passages Efficiently

The biggest mistake test-takers make on RC is trying to understand and memorize every detail on the first read. This is both unnecessary and counterproductive. The GMAT rewards **strategic reading** — understanding the big picture while knowing where to find details when needed.

### The Goal of Your First Read

Your first read should accomplish four things:

1. **Topic:** What is the passage about? (e.g., "the decline of coral reefs")
2. **Scope:** What specific aspect of the topic does the passage focus on? (e.g., "the role of ocean acidification in coral bleaching")
3. **Purpose:** Why did the author write this passage? (e.g., "to challenge the prevailing explanation for coral decline and propose an alternative")
4. **Tone:** What is the author's attitude? (e.g., "critical of the old theory, cautiously optimistic about the new one")

If you can articulate these four elements after your first read, you are well prepared for Main Idea and Structure questions — and most other question types as well.

### Active Reading Strategies

- **Read for structure, not details.** Note where each paragraph's main point is, but do not try to memorize specific numbers, names, or dates. You can always go back for those.
- **Identify paragraph roles.** As you finish each paragraph, mentally label it: "This paragraph introduces the problem," "This paragraph presents the counterargument," "This paragraph provides supporting evidence."
- **Watch for transition words.** Words like "however," "nevertheless," "in contrast," "moreover," and "consequently" signal shifts in the argument and are critical structural markers.
- **Note the author's opinion.** Many passages present multiple viewpoints. Always track which view the author supports or opposes.
- **Spend about 2.5 to 3 minutes on your initial read** for a full-length passage. This leaves adequate time to answer the associated questions.

## Main Idea / Primary Purpose Questions

### What They Ask

These questions ask you to identify the central point or purpose of the entire passage. They are testing whether you understood the passage at the highest level.

Typical question stems include:

- "The primary purpose of the passage is to..."
- "Which of the following best describes the main idea of the passage?"
- "The passage is primarily concerned with..."
- "The author's main point is that..."

### How to Approach

1. **Recall your TSPT (Topic, Scope, Purpose, Tone).** The main idea should align with all four of these elements.
2. **Eliminate answers that are too narrow.** If an answer only captures the content of one paragraph, it is a detail, not the main idea.
3. **Eliminate answers that are too broad.** If an answer describes a topic that is wider than what the passage actually discusses, it goes beyond the passage's scope.
4. **Check the purpose verb.** Main idea answers often begin with a verb (describe, argue, challenge, explain, compare). Make sure the verb accurately reflects what the author does.

### Common Trap Answers

- **Too narrow:** Focuses on a single paragraph or detail instead of the whole passage.
- **Too broad:** Describes the general subject area but not the passage's specific argument.
- **Wrong purpose verb:** Says the author "criticizes" when the author merely "describes," or says the author "proposes a solution" when the author only "analyzes a problem."
- **Distorted claim:** Includes accurate details from the passage but combines them in a way that misrepresents the overall point.

### Example Passage and Analysis

> *Paragraph 1: For decades, economists assumed that minimum wage increases would lead to significant job losses among low-skilled workers, based on classical supply-and-demand models.*
>
> *Paragraph 2: However, a landmark 1994 study by Card and Krueger compared employment at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey (which raised its minimum wage) and Pennsylvania (which did not) and found no significant difference in employment levels.*
>
> *Paragraph 3: While the Card-Krueger study has been challenged on methodological grounds, subsequent research using more sophisticated techniques has largely confirmed that moderate minimum wage increases do not cause the substantial job losses predicted by classical models, though the effects on hours worked and non-wage benefits remain a subject of active investigation.*

**TSPT Analysis:**
- **Topic:** Minimum wage and employment
- **Scope:** Whether minimum wage increases cause job losses
- **Purpose:** To describe how empirical evidence has challenged the classical economic prediction about minimum wage
- **Tone:** Generally neutral, presenting the evolution of understanding

**Primary purpose:** The passage is primarily concerned with **describing how empirical research has challenged the classical economic assumption that minimum wage increases significantly reduce employment**.

**Trap answer:** "To argue that minimum wage increases have no negative economic effects." (Too broad — the passage specifically says effects on hours and benefits are still being studied.)

## Passage Structure Questions

### What They Ask

Structure questions test whether you understand how the passage is organized and how different parts relate to each other.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?"
- "The second paragraph serves primarily to..."
- "How does the third paragraph relate to the first two paragraphs?"
- "The passage is organized in which of the following ways?"

### Common Passage Structures

Recognizing these patterns will help you answer structure questions more quickly:

**1. Compare and Contrast**
The passage presents two or more theories, viewpoints, or phenomena and examines their similarities and differences.

> *Structure: Theory A is presented -> Theory B is presented -> Key differences are analyzed -> Author may favor one theory*

**2. Cause and Effect**
The passage describes a phenomenon and then explains what causes it (or what effects it has).

> *Structure: Phenomenon described -> Cause(s) explored -> Evidence presented -> Implications discussed*

**3. Problem and Solution**
The passage identifies a problem and then proposes or evaluates one or more solutions.

> *Structure: Problem stated -> Previous attempts described -> New solution proposed -> Evidence for/against the solution*

**4. Chronological / Historical Development**
The passage traces the evolution of an idea, theory, or practice over time.

> *Structure: Early understanding -> Key development or discovery -> Modern understanding -> Current debates*

**5. Thesis and Support**
The author states a position and then provides evidence and reasoning to support it.

> *Structure: Author's claim stated -> Evidence 1 -> Evidence 2 -> Counterargument addressed -> Conclusion reaffirmed*

**6. Challenge to Conventional Wisdom**
The passage presents a widely held view and then argues against it.

> *Structure: Conventional view described -> Problems with that view identified -> Alternative explanation proposed -> Evidence for alternative*

### How to Approach Structure Questions

1. **Refer to your mental paragraph map.** During your initial read, you should have identified each paragraph's role.
2. **Match the overall pattern** to one of the common structures listed above.
3. **For paragraph-specific questions,** reread the first and last sentences of the relevant paragraph. These usually capture the paragraph's role.
4. **Pay attention to transition words between paragraphs.** These reveal the logical relationship (contrast, addition, cause-effect, etc.).

## Creating a Mental Passage Map

A **passage map** is a brief mental (or scratch-paper) outline that captures the role of each paragraph. You do not need to write out full sentences — just a few words per paragraph.

### Example Passage Map

For the minimum wage passage above, your map might look like:

- **P1:** Classical prediction — min wage increase = job losses
- **P2:** Card-Krueger study challenges this — no job losses found
- **P3:** Subsequent research mostly confirms Card-Krueger; some questions remain

This map takes seconds to create but saves significant time when answering questions because you know exactly where to look for specific information.

### Benefits of Passage Mapping

- **Speeds up question answering** by telling you exactly which paragraph to revisit.
- **Prevents re-reading the entire passage** for every question.
- **Helps with structure questions** because you have already identified each paragraph's role.
- **Keeps you focused** during your initial read so you do not get lost in details.

## Practice Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Purpose Verb Drill

After reading any RC passage (in practice), write down the primary purpose using a single verb and a brief phrase:

- "To **challenge** the assumption that..."
- "To **explain** why a certain phenomenon occurs..."
- "To **compare** two competing theories about..."
- "To **describe** the development of..."

If you cannot articulate the purpose in this format, you have not fully understood the passage. Go back and reread.

### Strategy 2: Paragraph Labeling

As you practice, label each paragraph with one of these roles:

- **Introduction / Background:** Sets the scene or introduces the topic.
- **Thesis / Main Claim:** States the author's primary argument.
- **Supporting Evidence:** Provides data, examples, or reasoning for the thesis.
- **Counterargument:** Presents an opposing view or potential objection.
- **Rebuttal:** Addresses the counterargument and reasserts the thesis.
- **Conclusion / Implication:** Summarizes the argument or discusses broader implications.

### Strategy 3: Predicting Before Answering

Before looking at the answer choices for a main idea question, formulate your own one-sentence summary of the passage. Then look for the answer that most closely matches your summary. This prevents you from being swayed by attractive but incorrect choices.

### Strategy 4: Eliminating with Extreme Prejudice

On main idea questions, you can often eliminate three or four answers quickly:

- Does the answer mention something only discussed in one paragraph? **Eliminate** (too narrow).
- Does the answer describe a broader topic than the passage covers? **Eliminate** (too broad).
- Does the answer use a verb that does not match what the author does? **Eliminate** (wrong purpose).
- Does the answer contradict the author's tone? **Eliminate** (wrong tone).

## Example: Full Passage Analysis

> *The discovery of high-temperature superconductors in 1986 sparked enormous excitement in the physics community. Unlike conventional superconductors, which require cooling to near absolute zero, these new ceramic materials exhibited superconductivity at temperatures achievable with liquid nitrogen — a far cheaper and more accessible coolant.*
>
> *Researchers initially predicted that practical applications, such as lossless power transmission and magnetically levitated trains, would follow within a decade. However, high-temperature superconductors proved extremely difficult to manufacture into the wires and cables needed for most industrial applications. The ceramic materials were brittle, difficult to form into long lengths, and lost their superconducting properties when subjected to strong magnetic fields.*
>
> *In recent years, incremental advances in materials science have allowed engineers to produce superconducting cables that can carry significantly more current than earlier prototypes. While commercial applications remain limited, the steady progress suggests that some of the original predictions may yet be realized, though on a much longer timeline than initially hoped.*

**Passage Map:**
- **P1:** Discovery of high-temp superconductors — exciting because they work at higher temps
- **P2:** Early predictions of applications were wrong — manufacturing problems
- **P3:** Recent progress — applications may still come, but slowly

**Primary Purpose:** To **trace the development** of high-temperature superconductor technology from its promising discovery through early setbacks to recent incremental progress.

**Structure:** Chronological / historical development with elements of problem-solution.

**Structure Question:** "The second paragraph serves primarily to..."
**Answer:** Explain why the initial optimism about high-temperature superconductors proved premature by describing specific manufacturing challenges.

## GMAT Tips

- **Do not memorize details on first read.** Your first pass should focus on understanding the passage's purpose, structure, and tone. You will go back for details when specific questions require them.
- **Spend 2.5 to 3 minutes reading, then 1 to 1.5 minutes per question.** This pacing keeps you on track. Rushing the initial read to save time almost always backfires because you end up rereading the passage multiple times.
- **The main idea is always the author's point, not someone else's.** If the passage describes multiple viewpoints, the main idea reflects the author's position — not the position the author presents and then refutes.
- **Structure answers should describe what the passage does, not what it says.** A structure answer should use organizational language ("introduces a phenomenon," "presents evidence against," "offers an alternative explanation") rather than content-specific language.
- **Watch out for "bait" answers that accurately describe one paragraph** but not the whole passage. Main idea and structure questions are about the entire passage.
- **RC passages often have a "turn" — a point where the author shifts direction.** Finding this turn (often marked by "however," "but," "yet," or "nevertheless") is the single most important structural insight you can gain.
- **Practice with a variety of topics.** GMAT RC passages cover science, business, social science, and humanities. Even if a topic is unfamiliar, the structural patterns are the same. Train yourself to focus on structure rather than content.
- **Do not let difficult vocabulary slow you down.** Technical terms are often defined in context or are not essential to answering the questions. Focus on understanding the role of the sentence, not every individual word.
