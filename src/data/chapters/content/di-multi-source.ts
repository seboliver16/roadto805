# Multi-Source Reasoning

Multi-Source Reasoning (MSR) questions are unique to the GMAT Data Insights section. They test your ability to synthesize information from **multiple sources** --- typically presented as two or three clickable tabs --- and draw conclusions by cross-referencing data across those sources. In the real world, professionals constantly combine information from emails, reports, spreadsheets, and memos to make decisions. MSR questions simulate exactly this skill.

---

## What MSR Looks Like on the GMAT

An MSR question set presents you with:

- **2 to 3 tabbed sources** on the left side of the screen. Each tab might contain a different type of information: an email thread, a data table, a short article, a company memo, a policy document, a chart, or a set of rules.
- **One or more questions** on the right side that require you to integrate information from across the tabs.

You can click between tabs freely, but **you cannot see all tabs simultaneously**. This is a deliberate design choice --- it tests your ability to hold information in working memory and organize it mentally.

Each MSR question set typically yields **2 to 3 questions** based on the same set of tabs. The questions may be:

- **Multiple-choice** (select the best answer from five options)
- **Yes/No or True/False table format** (evaluate three statements, marking each as Yes or No)

---

## Types of Sources

Understanding the common source types helps you know what to look for:

### Emails and Memos

These contain **qualitative information**: opinions, plans, constraints, or directives. Key details are often buried in the middle of the text. Watch for:

- **Conditional statements** ("If the budget exceeds $50K, we need VP approval")
- **Dates and deadlines**
- **Names and roles** (who is responsible for what)
- **Qualifications and exceptions** ("All locations except the downtown branch")

### Data Tables and Spreadsheets

These contain **quantitative information**: numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, dates, or category labels. Watch for:

- **Column headers** (what does each column represent?)
- **Units** (thousands? millions? percentages? per capita?)
- **Missing data** (blank cells may be significant)
- **Footnotes** (these often contain critical caveats)

### Reports and Articles

These provide **context or background**: market analyses, summaries of studies, descriptions of processes, or historical information. Watch for:

- **Definitions** of specialized terms
- **Assumptions** stated in the report
- **Causal claims** vs. correlations
- **Time periods** the data covers

### Charts and Graphs

These present **visual data**: trends, distributions, or comparisons. Watch for:

- **Axis labels and scales** (are both axes starting at zero?)
- **Legends** (which line or bar represents what?)
- **Time ranges** (does the chart cover the same period as the table?)

## Core Strategy: Skim All Tabs First

**Before reading any question**, spend 60 to 90 seconds skimming all tabs. Your goals during this initial skim are:

1. **Identify the type of information in each tab.** Tab 1 is an email about a project timeline. Tab 2 is a budget table. Tab 3 is a policy document with approval thresholds.

2. **Note where different types of data live.** Quantitative data is in Tab 2. Rules and constraints are in Tab 3. Plans and opinions are in Tab 1.

3. **Do NOT try to memorize details.** You will return to the tabs when answering questions. The skim is about building a mental map so you know *where* to look.

4. **Look for connections between tabs.** Does the email reference numbers from the table? Does the policy document define terms used in the report?

After skimming, read the first question, then go back to the relevant tabs to find the specific information you need.

---

## Cross-Referencing Data

The defining skill of MSR is **cross-referencing**: combining a piece of information from one source with a piece of information from another source to reach a conclusion.

### Example of Cross-Referencing

- **Tab 1 (Email):** "We need to ship at least 500 units to each regional warehouse by March 15."
- **Tab 2 (Inventory Table):** Shows current stock at each warehouse and daily production rates.
- **Tab 3 (Shipping Schedule):** Lists shipping routes and transit times.

A question might ask: "Can the company meet the March 15 deadline for all warehouses?" To answer this, you need to:

1. Check the current stock at each warehouse (Tab 2).
2. Calculate how many additional units each warehouse needs (Tab 1 threshold minus Tab 2 stock).
3. Determine if production can cover the shortfall in time (Tab 2 production rate times days remaining).
4. Check if shipping times allow delivery by the deadline (Tab 3).

This requires data from **all three tabs** and involves both reading comprehension and arithmetic.

## Calculations Across Sources

Many MSR questions require simple calculations, but the numbers come from different tabs. Common calculation types include:

- **Differences and comparisons:** "How much more did Region A spend than Region B?" (one tab has Region A data, another has Region B data)
- **Percentages:** "What percentage of total revenue came from online sales?" (total revenue in one tab, online sales in another)
- **Rates and totals:** "At the production rate described in the memo, how many units would be produced in the time period shown in the schedule?"
- **Threshold comparisons:** "Does the proposed budget exceed the approval limit described in the policy?"

**Tip:** Write down key numbers from each tab on your scratch paper before calculating. This saves you from flipping back and forth between tabs.

---

## Yes/No MSR Questions

In the Yes/No format, you are given three statements and must evaluate each as **Yes** or **No** (or sometimes **True/False** or **Inferable/Not Inferable**). Key strategies:

- **Each statement is independent.** The answer to one does not affect the others.
- **"Can be determined" vs. "Is true."** Some questions ask whether a statement *can be inferred* from the sources, not whether it is factually true. Stick to what the sources say.
- **Look for absolute language.** Statements with words like "all," "none," "always," or "never" are often false because a single exception disproves them.
- **Look for hedging language.** Statements with "some," "may," or "at least one" are often true because they only require one confirming example.

---

## Multiple-Choice MSR Questions

For standard multiple-choice MSR questions:

- **Eliminate answers that contradict information in any tab.** If an answer says "Revenue increased every quarter" but the table shows a dip in Q3, eliminate it.
- **Be wary of answers that are partially true.** An answer might correctly reference data from Tab 1 but misstate data from Tab 2.
- **Check every source** before committing to an answer. An answer that seems right based on one tab might be contradicted by another.

---

## Time Management for MSR

MSR question sets are among the most time-consuming on the GMAT. Budget your time wisely:

- **Initial skim of all tabs:** 60--90 seconds
- **Per question:** 60--90 seconds
- **Total for a 3-question MSR set:** approximately 4--5 minutes

If you find yourself spending more than 5 minutes on a set, make your best guess on the remaining questions and move on. Getting bogged down in one MSR set can cost you time on easier questions later.

**Prioritize:** If one question in the set seems much harder than the others, answer the easier ones first and return to the hard one if time allows.

## Example Scenarios with Analysis

### Example Scenario 1: Budget Approval

**Tab 1 --- Email from CFO to Department Heads:**
"All departmental expenditures above $25,000 require Finance Committee approval. Expenditures above $100,000 additionally require Board approval. Any recurring monthly expense must be annualized for approval threshold purposes."

**Tab 2 --- Q3 Budget Requests Table:**

| Department | Item | Monthly Cost | Duration |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|
| Marketing | Ad Campaign | $8,500 | 6 months |
| IT | Server Upgrade | $45,000 | One-time |
| HR | Recruiting Platform | $3,200 | 12 months |
| Operations | Warehouse Lease | $9,500 | 12 months |

**Question:** For how many of the budget requests is Board approval required?

**Analysis:**
- Marketing Ad Campaign: $8,500/month for 6 months. Annualized? The email says recurring monthly expenses must be annualized. $8,500 $\\times$ 12 = $102,000 annualized. This exceeds $100,000, so Board approval is required.
- IT Server Upgrade: $45,000 one-time. Above $25,000 (needs Finance Committee) but below $100,000 (no Board approval needed).
- HR Recruiting Platform: $3,200/month for 12 months. Annualized: $3,200 $\\times$ 12 = $38,400. Above $25,000 (Finance Committee) but below $100,000 (no Board).
- Operations Warehouse Lease: $9,500/month for 12 months. Annualized: $9,500 $\\times$ 12 = $114,000. Above $100,000, so Board approval is required.

**Answer:** 2 requests require Board approval (Marketing and Operations).

**Key cross-reference:** The annualization rule from Tab 1 had to be applied to the monthly costs in Tab 2.

### Example Scenario 2: Shipping and Logistics

**Tab 1 --- Distribution Policy:**
"Standard shipping takes 5 business days. Express shipping takes 2 business days. Orders placed after 3:00 PM are processed the next business day. Weekends and holidays are not business days."

**Tab 2 --- Order Log:**

| Order | Placed | Method | Destination |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| #101 | Mon 2:15 PM | Standard | Region A |
| #102 | Wed 4:30 PM | Express | Region B |
| #103 | Fri 1:00 PM | Standard | Region C |

**Tab 3 --- Calendar Note:** The following Monday is a national holiday.

**Question (Yes/No):** For each order, determine whether it will arrive by the following Friday.

**Analysis:**
- Order #101: Placed Monday at 2:15 PM (before 3:00 PM cutoff), so processed Monday. Standard = 5 business days. Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon --- but Monday is a holiday, so the 5th business day is the following Tuesday. Arrives **Tuesday**. Does NOT arrive by Friday of the same week, but the question says "the following Friday" --- that would be the Friday after the holiday Monday. It **does** arrive by the following Friday. **Yes.**
- Order #102: Placed Wednesday at 4:30 PM (after 3:00 PM), so processed Thursday. Express = 2 business days. Fri, Mon --- but Monday is a holiday, so the 2nd business day is Tuesday. Arrives **Tuesday**. **Yes.**
- Order #103: Placed Friday at 1:00 PM (before cutoff), processed Friday. Standard = 5 business days. Mon is a holiday, so: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, and the following Mon. Arrives **Monday** (the Monday after "the following Friday"). **No.**

**Key cross-reference:** The 3:00 PM cutoff from Tab 1, the order times from Tab 2, and the holiday from Tab 3 all had to be combined.

### Example Scenario 3: Employee Performance Data

**Tab 1 --- HR Memo:**
"Employees scoring 85 or above on the annual review are eligible for promotion. Employees scoring below 70 are placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP). All employees in the Sales department are also eligible for the quarterly bonus if they met at least 90% of their sales target."

**Tab 2 --- Review Scores:**

| Employee | Department | Review Score | Sales Target Met (%) |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Adams | Sales | 88 | 95% |
| Blake | Engineering | 72 | N/A |
| Carter | Sales | 67 | 102% |
| Diaz | Sales | 91 | 85% |

**Question:** Which employees are eligible for both promotion and the quarterly bonus?

**Analysis:**
- Adams: Score 88 $\\ge$ 85 (promotion eligible). Sales dept and 95% $\\ge$ 90% target (bonus eligible). **Both.**
- Blake: Score 72. 72 $\\ge$ 85? No, not promotion eligible. Also not in Sales. **Neither.**
- Carter: Score 67 < 70 (PIP, not promotion eligible). Even though 102% $\\ge$ 90%, no promotion. **Bonus only.**
- Diaz: Score 91 $\\ge$ 85 (promotion eligible). Sales dept but 85% < 90% target. **Promotion only.**

**Answer:** Only Adams is eligible for both.

## Common MSR Traps

1. **Ignoring one of the tabs.** Every tab is there for a reason. If you answer a question using only two out of three tabs, double-check whether the third tab contains relevant caveats, exceptions, or additional data.

2. **Misreading units or time periods.** One tab might show monthly data while another shows annual data. Always check whether the numbers are directly comparable.

3. **Confusing stated facts with opinions.** An email might say "I believe our market share is growing," but the data table might show it is flat. The question might ask what the data supports, not what the email claims.

4. **Overlooking qualifications.** Phrases like "except," "unless," "only if," and "provided that" create exceptions to general rules. These qualifications are often the key to the correct answer.

5. **Assuming information not provided.** If none of the tabs mention a particular fact, you cannot infer it. Stick strictly to what is stated or directly calculable from the sources.

6. **Rushing through the initial skim.** Spending an extra 30 seconds up front to understand the structure of the sources can save you minutes of confused flipping between tabs later.

## GMAT Tips

1. **Build a mental map during the initial skim.** Know which tab has rules, which has data, and which has context. Write one-word labels on your scratch paper: "Tab 1 = email/rules, Tab 2 = numbers, Tab 3 = calendar."

2. **Use scratch paper aggressively.** Write down key numbers, thresholds, or rules so you do not have to flip tabs repeatedly. Copy small tables or key constraints.

3. **For Yes/No questions, evaluate each statement independently.** Do not let your answer to one statement influence another.

4. **Read the question before diving deep into the tabs.** After your initial skim, the question tells you *which* information you actually need. Do not waste time studying irrelevant details.

5. **Watch for "trick" phrasing in statements.** A statement that says "at least 3 employees" is true if 3, 4, or more qualify. A statement that says "exactly 3" is only true if the number is precisely 3.

6. **On the real GMAT, MSR sets are not adaptive** --- you see the same tabs regardless of your score level. The questions based on those tabs may vary in difficulty, but the source material stays the same.

7. **If you cannot determine the answer from the given sources, it might be "Cannot be determined."** Some questions test whether you recognize when data is insufficient. Do not make up information to force an answer.

8. **Practice with real GMAT MSR sets.** The format is unique enough that familiarity is a significant advantage. The more sets you work through, the faster your tab-navigation and cross-referencing skills become.
