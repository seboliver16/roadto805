# Critical Reasoning: Weaken & Strengthen

Critical Reasoning (CR) questions are a cornerstone of the GMAT Verbal section. Among the various CR question types, **Weaken** and **Strengthen** questions appear most frequently and are among the most important to master. This chapter will teach you how to break down arguments, identify conclusions, and systematically find the answer choice that either undermines or supports the author's reasoning.

## What Is an Argument?

Before you can weaken or strengthen anything, you need to understand what an **argument** is. On the GMAT, an argument is not a heated debate — it is a structured piece of reasoning with two core components:

- **Premises (Evidence):** The facts, data, or observations that the author presents as given. These are the building blocks of the argument and are treated as true.
- **Conclusion:** The claim or assertion that the author draws based on the premises. This is the part the author wants you to accept.

The **gap** between the premises and the conclusion is where all the action happens. The conclusion almost always goes beyond what the evidence strictly proves, and that logical gap is what weaken and strengthen questions target.

**Example Argument:**

> *A study found that employees who take regular lunch breaks report higher job satisfaction than those who eat at their desks. Therefore, companies that mandate lunch breaks will see improvements in employee job satisfaction.*

- **Premise:** Employees who take lunch breaks report higher satisfaction.
- **Conclusion:** Mandating lunch breaks will improve satisfaction.
- **Gap:** The premise describes a correlation (people who choose to take breaks are happier), but the conclusion assumes causation (forcing breaks will cause happiness). Maybe the employees who take breaks are already happier for other reasons.

## How to Identify the Conclusion

Finding the conclusion is your **first and most critical step** in any CR question. Without correctly identifying the conclusion, you cannot evaluate the answer choices.

### Conclusion Indicators
Look for signal words that introduce conclusions:

- **Therefore**, thus, hence, consequently
- **So**, accordingly, as a result
- **It follows that**, this shows that, this means that
- **Clearly**, evidently, we can conclude that

### Premise Indicators
These words introduce evidence, not the conclusion:

- **Because**, since, given that, due to
- **Studies show**, research indicates, data suggests
- **After all**, for, as evidenced by

### The "Why?" Test
If you are unsure which statement is the conclusion, ask yourself: "Which statement is being supported by the other?" The statement that answers "why?" is the premise; the statement being supported is the conclusion.

### Position in the Passage
The conclusion can appear **anywhere** in the passage — beginning, middle, or end. Do not assume it is always the last sentence. GMAT test-makers deliberately vary conclusion placement.

## Weaken Questions

### What They Ask

Weaken questions ask you to find the answer choice that **undermines the connection** between the evidence and the conclusion. You are not disproving the conclusion entirely — you are making it less likely to be true.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?"
- "Which of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the conclusion above?"
- "Which of the following, if true, most undermines the reasoning above?"

### The Core Approach

1. **Identify the conclusion.**
2. **Identify the evidence (premises).**
3. **Find the gap** — what does the conclusion assume that the evidence does not prove?
4. **Look for the answer that attacks the gap.**

### Common Weakener Types

**1. Alternative Cause**
The argument claims A causes B, but the correct answer shows C could also cause B.

> *Argument: Sales increased after the new advertising campaign launched. Therefore, the advertising campaign caused the increase in sales.*
> *Weakener: A major competitor went out of business during the same period.*

**2. Breaks the Analogy / Scope Shift**
The conclusion applies the evidence to a different group, time, or context than what was studied.

> *Argument: A drug reduced symptoms in lab mice by 40%. Therefore, it will be effective for human patients.*
> *Weakener: The biological mechanism targeted by the drug functions differently in humans than in mice.*

**3. Missing or Contradicting Data**
New information shows the evidence is incomplete or points in the opposite direction.

> *Argument: Company X's revenue grew 20% this year, so the company is in strong financial health.*
> *Weakener: Company X's costs increased by 50% during the same period.*

**4. Reverses the Cause and Effect**
The argument assumes A causes B, but perhaps B actually causes A.

> *Argument: People who read more books earn higher salaries. Therefore, reading more books leads to higher earnings.*
> *Weakener: Higher-earning individuals have more leisure time and resources to spend on books.*

**5. Implementation Problems**
The argument proposes a plan or solution, and the weakener shows the plan will not work as intended.

> *Argument: The city should install speed cameras to reduce traffic accidents.*
> *Weakener: Drivers who know the camera locations simply brake before the camera and then resume speeding afterward.*

## Strengthen Questions

### What They Ask

Strengthen questions are the mirror image of weaken questions. You must find the answer choice that **supports the link** between the evidence and the conclusion, making the conclusion more likely to be true.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?"
- "Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the conclusion above?"
- "Which of the following, if true, most helps to justify the conclusion?"

### The Core Approach

The process is identical to weaken questions, except in step 4 you look for the answer that **reinforces the gap** rather than attacking it.

1. **Identify the conclusion.**
2. **Identify the evidence.**
3. **Find the gap.**
4. **Look for the answer that bridges the gap or rules out alternative explanations.**

### Common Strengthener Types

**1. Rules Out Alternative Causes**
If the argument claims A causes B, the strengthener shows that other possible causes of B are not present.

> *Argument: The advertising campaign caused the increase in sales.*
> *Strengthener: No other significant changes in the market or the company's operations occurred during the campaign period.*

**2. Provides Supporting Data**
Additional evidence that confirms the trend or pattern cited in the argument.

> *Argument: The new training program improved employee performance.*
> *Strengthener: Employees in departments that did not receive the training showed no improvement during the same period.*

**3. Confirms the Mechanism**
Shows that the proposed cause-and-effect relationship has a plausible mechanism.

> *Argument: Drinking green tea reduces the risk of heart disease.*
> *Strengthener: Green tea contains antioxidants that have been shown to reduce arterial inflammation.*

**4. Eliminates a Potential Objection**
Addresses a potential weakness before it can be raised.

> *Argument: The city's new recycling program will reduce landfill waste by 30%.*
> *Strengthener: Residents in the pilot program did not simply shift their waste to neighboring municipalities.*

## Step-by-Step Approach for CR Questions

Follow this disciplined process for every CR weaken/strengthen question:

1. **Read the question stem FIRST.** Know whether you are weakening or strengthening before you read the argument.
2. **Read the argument carefully.** Identify the conclusion and premises. Mentally note the gap.
3. **Predict the answer.** Before looking at the choices, think about what kind of information would weaken or strengthen the argument. This prediction does not need to be exact — it is a compass, not a GPS.
4. **Evaluate each answer choice.** Ask: "Does this make the conclusion more or less likely?" Eliminate choices that are irrelevant, that go in the wrong direction, or that are too extreme.
5. **Pick the best answer.** Sometimes no answer perfectly matches your prediction. Choose the one that most directly affects the gap between evidence and conclusion.

## Example Analysis

### Example 1: Weaken

> *A pharmaceutical company found that patients who took Drug X for six months showed a 35% reduction in cholesterol levels. The company concluded that Drug X is effective at lowering cholesterol and should be approved for widespread use.*

**Conclusion:** Drug X is effective and should be approved for widespread use.

**Evidence:** Patients who took Drug X for six months had a 35% cholesterol reduction.

**Gap:** Were there other factors? Was there a control group? Does effectiveness in a trial translate to effectiveness in widespread use?

**Weakener:** *The study did not include a placebo control group, and patients in the study also adopted a low-fat diet during the trial period.*

**Why this works:** It introduces an alternative explanation — the diet could be responsible for the cholesterol reduction, not Drug X.

### Example 2: Strengthen

> *A school district implemented a new reading curriculum and saw a 15% improvement in standardized reading test scores over two years. The superintendent argues that the new curriculum is responsible for the improvement.*

**Conclusion:** The new curriculum caused the improvement.

**Evidence:** Scores improved 15% over two years after the curriculum was implemented.

**Gap:** Could other factors explain the improvement?

**Strengthener:** *Schools in neighboring districts that did not adopt the new curriculum saw no significant change in reading scores during the same period.*

**Why this works:** By showing that schools without the curriculum did not improve, it rules out external factors (e.g., a generally easier test, demographic changes) and isolates the curriculum as the cause.

### Example 3: Weaken

> *The manager of a restaurant noticed that customer complaints dropped by 40% after the restaurant began playing classical music during dinner hours. The manager concluded that the classical music improved the dining experience.*

**Conclusion:** Classical music improved the dining experience.

**Evidence:** Complaints dropped 40% after the music was introduced.

**Weakener:** *Around the same time the music was introduced, the restaurant also hired a new head chef who overhauled the menu.*

**Why this works:** It provides an alternative cause for the drop in complaints.

### Example 4: Strengthen

> *City officials propose that building a new highway bypass around the downtown area will reduce traffic congestion in the city center by diverting through-traffic away from local streets.*

**Conclusion:** The bypass will reduce downtown congestion.

**Evidence:** The bypass will divert through-traffic.

**Strengthener:** *Traffic studies indicate that over 60% of vehicles currently passing through the downtown area are through-traffic with no downtown destination.*

**Why this works:** It confirms the key assumption — that a significant portion of downtown traffic is actually through-traffic that would use the bypass.

## Common Wrong Answer Traps

Be on the lookout for these frequently occurring wrong answer types:

- **Irrelevant Comparison:** The answer introduces a comparison that has no bearing on the argument. For example, comparing Drug X to Drug Y when the argument is only about whether Drug X works.
- **Too Extreme:** The answer uses absolute language ("always," "never," "all," "none") that goes far beyond what is needed to weaken or strengthen the argument.
- **Opposite Effect:** On weaken questions, a strengthener will appear among the choices (and vice versa). Read carefully to ensure you are going in the right direction.
- **True but Irrelevant:** The answer may state something that is reasonable or true in the real world but does not address the specific gap in the argument.
- **Addresses a Different Conclusion:** The answer weakens or strengthens a claim that is related to but different from the actual conclusion.

## GMAT Tips

- **Accept "if true."** Every answer choice on CR questions is to be taken as true. Do not waste time evaluating whether an answer choice is realistic. Your only job is to assess its logical impact on the argument.
- **Focus on the gap, not the evidence.** The premises are given as facts. You cannot weaken an argument by disputing the evidence. You weaken it by showing the evidence does not support the conclusion.
- **Prediction is your best tool.** Forming even a rough prediction before you look at the answer choices dramatically reduces the chance of falling for a trap.
- **Watch for scope shifts.** If the evidence talks about one group and the conclusion applies to a different group, that shift is almost always where the weaken/strengthen dynamic lives.
- **Eliminate aggressively.** On difficult questions, eliminating four wrong answers is just as valid as identifying the right one.
- **Beware of new information in the conclusion.** If the conclusion introduces a concept not found in the premises, that new concept is the gap you should target.
- **Time management:** Aim to spend about 2 minutes per CR question. Read the question stem first, identify the conclusion quickly, and do not overthink the answer choices.
