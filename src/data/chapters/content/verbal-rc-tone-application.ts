# Reading Comprehension: Tone, Application & Comparison

This chapter covers three advanced RC question types that test your ability to go beyond basic comprehension: **Tone/Attitude** questions, **Application/Analogy** questions, and **Comparison** questions. These question types require you to understand not just what the passage says, but how the author feels about it, how the ideas could apply in different contexts, and how multiple viewpoints within the passage relate to each other.

## Author's Tone / Attitude Questions

### What They Ask

Tone questions ask you to characterize the author's **attitude or perspective** toward the subject matter. The GMAT tests whether you can detect the subtle emotional and intellectual stance embedded in the author's word choices and rhetorical approach.

Typical question stems include:

- "The author's attitude toward X can best be described as..."
- "The tone of the passage is best characterized as..."
- "The author's response to the critics mentioned in the passage is most likely one of..."
- "With which of the following characterizations of X would the author most likely agree?"

### Common Tones on the GMAT

GMAT passages are drawn from academic and professional sources, so the tones tend to be measured and restrained. Here are the most common tones you will encounter:

**Positive / Supportive Tones:**
- **Enthusiastic:** Strongly positive, excited about the subject (rare on the GMAT)
- **Optimistic:** Hopeful and positive about outcomes
- **Appreciative:** Recognizing the value or merit of something
- **Admiring:** Expressing respect for an achievement or contribution

**Neutral Tones:**
- **Objective:** Presenting facts without apparent judgment
- **Analytical:** Examining the subject in a balanced, methodical way
- **Informative:** Providing information without editorializing
- **Dispassionate:** Deliberately neutral, detached from the subject

**Negative / Critical Tones:**
- **Skeptical:** Doubtful, questioning the claims being discussed
- **Critical:** Finding fault with or disapproving of the subject
- **Cautious / Qualified:** Acknowledging merit but raising concerns or limitations
- **Dismissive:** Rejecting an idea as unworthy of serious consideration (uncommon on the GMAT)

**Mixed or Nuanced Tones:**
- **Ambivalent:** Having mixed feelings or seeing both positives and negatives
- **Cautiously optimistic:** Hopeful but with reservations
- **Respectful but critical:** Acknowledging contributions while pointing out flaws

### How to Identify Tone

1. **Look at word choices.** Adjectives and adverbs reveal attitude. "Innovative approach" vs. "questionable approach" vs. "interesting approach" convey very different stances.
2. **Watch for qualifying language.** "While the theory has merit, it fails to account for..." signals a nuanced, partially critical tone.
3. **Note the author's treatment of opposing views.** Does the author present counterarguments fairly (balanced tone) or dismiss them quickly (partisan tone)?
4. **Identify the author's conclusion.** The author's bottom line usually reveals their attitude most clearly.
5. **Distinguish the author's voice from cited voices.** The passage may quote someone who is enthusiastic, but the author may be skeptical of that person's enthusiasm.

### Example: Tone Analysis

> *Although proponents of charter schools argue that they foster innovation and improve educational outcomes, the evidence supporting these claims remains inconclusive. Several large-scale studies have found no statistically significant difference in academic performance between charter school students and their peers in traditional public schools. While some individual charter schools have achieved remarkable results, these successes have proven difficult to replicate at scale, suggesting that the charter model itself may be less important than other factors such as funding levels, community engagement, and teacher quality.*

**Author's tone:** **Skeptical** toward the claims of charter school proponents, but measured and evidence-based rather than hostile. The author acknowledges "remarkable results" at some schools (showing fairness) while arguing the overall evidence is "inconclusive" (showing doubt).

**Trap answers:**
- "Hostile toward charter schools" (too extreme — the author is skeptical, not hostile)
- "Enthusiastic about educational innovation" (opposite of the actual tone)
- "Completely neutral" (the author does take a position — that the evidence is inconclusive)

## Application Questions

### What They Ask

Application questions present a new scenario not discussed in the passage and ask you to determine how the passage's ideas, principles, or arguments would apply to this new context. These are among the most challenging RC questions because they require you to abstract the passage's logic and transfer it to an unfamiliar situation.

Typical question stems include:

- "Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to view which of the following as analogous to...?"
- "Which of the following situations is most similar to the one described in the passage?"
- "The author's argument about X would most likely apply to which of the following?"
- "If the author's reasoning is correct, which of the following would most likely be true?"

### How to Approach Application Questions

1. **Identify the principle or pattern being tested.** What is the passage's core argument, relationship, or logical structure? Abstract it from the specific details.
2. **Translate the principle into general terms.** For example, if the passage argues that "increased regulation of Industry X led to unintended consequences Y and Z," the general principle is "regulation can produce unintended consequences."
3. **Apply the general principle to each answer choice.** Which new scenario best mirrors the original pattern?
4. **Eliminate choices that share surface-level similarity but differ in underlying logic.** The correct answer matches the logical structure, not just the topic.

### Example: Application

> *Passage: A researcher studied the introduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and found that the wolves' predation on elk led to a cascade of ecological effects. With fewer elk grazing on riverbank vegetation, trees and shrubs recovered, stabilizing stream banks and improving habitat for fish and birds. The researcher concluded that the reintroduction of a single top predator can transform an entire ecosystem.*

**Application Question:** Which of the following situations is most analogous to the ecological effects described in the passage?

**(A)** A city plants trees along a highway to reduce noise pollution in adjacent neighborhoods.
**(B)** The introduction of a new bus route increases foot traffic near bus stops, leading to the growth of small businesses, which in turn attracts more residents to the area.
**(C)** A company hires additional security guards, leading to a decrease in shoplifting at its stores.
**(D)** A government imposes a new tax on sugary drinks, and consumers switch to buying water instead.
**(E)** A school extends its library hours, and students report improved access to research materials.

**Answer: (B).** The passage describes a **cascading chain of effects** triggered by a single change at the top of a system. Choice (B) mirrors this: a single infrastructure change (bus route) triggers a chain of consequences (foot traffic, businesses, residents). The other choices describe direct, single-step cause-and-effect relationships, not cascading chains.

## Analogy Questions

Analogy questions are a subset of application questions that specifically ask you to find a **parallel relationship** or **parallel situation** in the answer choices.

### How They Differ from Standard Application

While standard application questions ask how the passage's reasoning applies to a new scenario, analogy questions ask you to find a new scenario that **structurally mirrors** a specific relationship or situation described in the passage.

### Strategy for Analogies

1. **Identify the specific relationship the question references.** (e.g., "the relationship between X and Y described in the second paragraph")
2. **Characterize the relationship abstractly.** (e.g., "X was intended to achieve Goal A but instead produced Result B, which was the opposite of what was intended")
3. **Find the answer choice with the same abstract structure.**

## Comparison Questions

### What They Ask

Many GMAT RC passages present **multiple viewpoints, theories, or perspectives.** Comparison questions test whether you can accurately identify these different perspectives and understand how they relate to each other.

Typical question stems include:

- "The author would most likely disagree with which of the following statements?"
- "The 'critics' mentioned in line 12 would most likely respond to the author's conclusion by arguing that..."
- "The two theories discussed in the passage differ primarily in..."
- "Unlike the first study, the second study..."

### How to Handle Multiple Viewpoints

1. **Track each viewpoint separately.** As you read, mentally tag each perspective: "Author thinks X," "Critics argue Y," "Study 1 found A while Study 2 found B."
2. **Note the author's position relative to other viewpoints.** Does the author agree, disagree, or remain neutral?
3. **Identify specific points of agreement and disagreement.** Two viewpoints may agree on some aspects but diverge on others.
4. **Pay attention to concessions.** When an author says "While critics make a valid point about X, they fail to consider Y," the author is conceding X but disputing Y.

### Example: Comparison

> *Paragraph 1: Traditional economists argue that minimum wage increases lead to job losses because employers cannot afford to pay higher wages without reducing their workforce.*
>
> *Paragraph 2: Behavioral economists counter that minimum wage increases can actually boost employment because higher wages reduce employee turnover, increase productivity through improved morale, and stimulate consumer spending in the local economy.*
>
> *Paragraph 3: The author notes that both perspectives have empirical support in different contexts and suggests that the effect of minimum wage increases depends heavily on local economic conditions, the size of the increase, and the industry affected.*

**Comparison Question:** The traditional economists and behavioral economists described in the passage would most likely agree on which of the following?

**Analysis:** Despite their disagreement about the effect of minimum wage increases, both groups implicitly agree that **wage levels affect employer and employee behavior.** They disagree about the direction and magnitude of the effect, but they share the underlying premise that wages matter.

**Comparison Question:** The author's perspective differs from that of both the traditional and behavioral economists primarily in that the author:

**Answer:** Argues that the effect of minimum wage increases is context-dependent rather than universally positive or negative. The author takes a more nuanced, conditional position.

## "The Author Would Most Likely Agree" Questions

These are among the most common comparison/inference hybrid questions. They require you to understand the author's perspective well enough to predict how the author would respond to a statement not discussed in the passage.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the author's core position.** What is the main argument or perspective of the passage?
2. **Identify the author's values and priorities.** What does the author seem to care about? Evidence-based reasoning? Practical applications? Fairness?
3. **Test each answer choice against the author's position.** Would the author find this statement consistent with their argument? Or does it conflict?
4. **Be careful with statements the author might agree with personally but that are not supported by the passage.** Your job is to find what the passage supports, not what seems generally true.

### Example

> *Throughout the passage, the author argues that environmental regulations should be designed based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis rather than on emotional appeals or worst-case scenario projections. The author supports this position by citing cases where well-intentioned regulations produced costs far exceeding their benefits.*

**The author would most likely agree that:**

**(A)** Environmental regulations are generally unnecessary.
**(B)** Policymakers should prioritize economic data over environmental science when crafting regulations.
**(C)** A proposed regulation that would cost $10 billion but prevent only $500 million in environmental damage should be reconsidered.
**(D)** Cost-benefit analysis is the only valid tool for evaluating public policy.
**(E)** Environmental groups have too much influence on regulatory policy.

**Answer: (C).** The author argues for cost-benefit analysis, and this scenario clearly illustrates a case where costs vastly exceed benefits — consistent with the cases the author cites critically.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **(A)** Too extreme — the author supports well-designed regulations, not no regulations.
- **(B)** Distortion — the author values cost-benefit analysis, not economic data over environmental science.
- **(D)** Too extreme — "only valid tool" goes beyond what the passage supports.
- **(E)** Out of scope — the passage does not discuss the influence of environmental groups.

## Practice Strategies

### Strategy 1: Tone Word Bank

Build a vocabulary of tone descriptors and practice using them. After each passage, write down the author's tone using one of the terms listed in this chapter. If you can consistently identify tone accurately, these questions become reliable points.

### Strategy 2: Abstract Before Applying

For application and analogy questions, always translate the passage's specific situation into an abstract principle before looking at the answer choices. Write it as: "Situation where [abstract pattern]." Then match.

### Strategy 3: Viewpoint Tracking

When reading passages with multiple perspectives, use your scratch paper to create a simple viewpoint chart:

| | Traditional View | New View | Author |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claim | X causes Y | X causes Z | Depends on context |
| Evidence | Study A | Study B | Both valid |

This visual organization makes comparison questions much easier.

### Strategy 4: Elimination by Extremity

On tone and "author would agree" questions, the correct answer is almost never the most extreme option. GMAT passages are academic and measured. If an answer choice uses strong language ("completely wrong," "the only solution," "entirely without merit"), it is almost certainly incorrect.

## GMAT Tips

- **Tone is revealed through word choice, not content.** Two passages can discuss the same topic but have completely different tones. Focus on how the author describes things, not just what they describe.
- **GMAT tones are almost never extreme.** "Passionate advocacy" or "bitter resentment" are virtually never correct on the GMAT. Look for measured, professional tones like "qualified approval" or "respectful skepticism."
- **Application questions reward abstract thinking.** The correct answer often involves a completely different subject matter from the passage. Do not be drawn to answers that share the passage's topic but not its logic.
- **For comparison questions, re-read selectively.** Go back to the specific paragraphs where each viewpoint is presented rather than relying on your memory of the details.
- **"The author would agree" is really an inference question in disguise.** Apply the same rules: stay close to the passage, avoid extremes, and choose the most conservatively supported answer.
- **When stuck on tone, try the "dinner party" test.** Imagine the author reading the passage aloud at a dinner party. What would their facial expression and body language suggest? This mental exercise can help you intuit the tone.
- **Do not confuse the author's reporting of a viewpoint with the author's endorsement of it.** A passage may describe someone's enthusiasm at length while the author remains skeptical. Always ask: "Whose voice is this?"
- **Time management:** Tone questions should be quick (under 1.5 minutes) because they test your overall impression of the passage. Application and comparison questions may take closer to 2 minutes because they require more careful analysis.
- **On analogy questions, match the structure, not the story.** The correct answer will have the same logical relationship (cause-effect chain, unintended consequence, competing explanations, etc.) even if the subject matter is entirely different.
