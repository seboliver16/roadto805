# Reading Comprehension: Inference & Detail

After mastering Main Idea and Structure questions, the next most common RC question types are **Detail** (also called Supporting Idea) and **Inference** questions. Together, these two types account for the majority of RC questions you will encounter on the GMAT. Detail questions ask you to locate specific information stated in the passage, while Inference questions require you to draw logical conclusions from what the passage implies but does not state outright. Both reward careful, precise reading.

## Detail / Supporting Idea Questions

### What They Ask

Detail questions ask you to find a specific piece of information that is **explicitly stated** in the passage. The answer is directly in the text — your job is to locate it and match it to the correct answer choice (which is usually paraphrased, not quoted verbatim).

Typical question stems include:

- "According to the passage, which of the following is true about...?"
- "The passage states that..."
- "The author mentions which of the following as a reason for...?"
- "Which of the following is cited in the passage as...?"

### Key Characteristics

- The answer **is in the passage.** You should be able to point to the specific sentence(s) that support the correct answer.
- The correct answer **paraphrases** the passage. GMAT test-makers rarely use the exact same wording as the passage. Instead, they restate the information using different vocabulary and sentence structures.
- **Wrong answers** will often use language from the passage but distort the meaning, combine unrelated details, or introduce information not found in the text.

### How to Approach Detail Questions

1. **Read the question carefully and identify the key terms.** What specific concept, person, study, or event is the question asking about?
2. **Use your passage map to locate the relevant section.** If your map says "P2: manufacturing challenges," and the question asks about obstacles to commercial use, go straight to paragraph 2.
3. **Reread the relevant portion carefully.** Do not rely on memory — go back to the text and verify.
4. **Match the passage language to the answer choices.** Look for the choice that says the same thing as the passage using different words.
5. **Eliminate answers that distort, extend, or contradict the passage.**

### Using Line References and Keywords

Many detail questions contain **clues** that point you to the right location in the passage:

- **Direct references:** "In the second paragraph, the author states..." (Go to paragraph 2.)
- **Keyword matching:** If the question asks about "the Card-Krueger study," scan the passage for those names.
- **Concept matching:** If the question asks about "manufacturing obstacles," look for the paragraph that discusses challenges or problems.

### Example: Detail Question

> *Passage excerpt: "The high failure rate among new restaurants — estimated at 60% within the first three years — is often attributed to undercapitalization. However, a recent survey of 500 former restaurant owners found that the most commonly cited reason for failure was not lack of funding but rather poor location selection."*

**Question:** According to the passage, the survey of former restaurant owners found that the primary cause of restaurant failure was:

**(A)** insufficient initial capital
**(B)** inadequate selection of business location
**(C)** inability to attract repeat customers
**(D)** excessive competition in the market
**(E)** failure to adapt the menu to customer preferences

**Answer: (B).** The passage directly states that "the most commonly cited reason for failure was not lack of funding but rather poor location selection." Answer (B) paraphrases "poor location selection" as "inadequate selection of business location."

**Why (A) is wrong:** The passage explicitly says the answer was "not lack of funding."
**Why (C), (D), and (E) are wrong:** These are not mentioned in the passage.

## Inference Questions

### What They Ask

Inference questions ask you to identify something that is **implied** or **suggested** by the passage but **not directly stated.** The correct answer must be logically supported by the passage, even though you cannot point to a single sentence that says it outright.

Typical question stems include:

- "It can be inferred from the passage that..."
- "The passage implies that..."
- "The author would most likely agree that..."
- "Which of the following is suggested by the passage?"
- "Based on the passage, it is most reasonable to conclude that..."

### The Difference Between "Stated" and "Inferred"

This distinction is critical and is one of the most tested concepts on the GMAT:

- **Stated (Detail):** The information appears directly in the passage. You can underline the sentence that provides the answer.
- **Inferred:** The information is not directly stated but follows logically from what is stated. You must combine or extend ideas from the passage to reach the conclusion.

**Example:**

> *Passage: "The museum's annual budget has decreased by 15% over the past three years, and two of its five permanent galleries have been closed to the public."*

- **Stated:** The budget decreased by 15%. Two galleries closed.
- **Inferred:** The museum is facing financial difficulties. (This is never said directly, but it logically follows from a shrinking budget and gallery closures.)

### Avoiding Extreme Inferences

The most common mistake on RC inference questions is going too far beyond what the passage supports. A valid GMAT inference is a **small, careful step** — not a giant leap.

**Rules to follow:**

- **The inference must be supported by specific passage content.** If you cannot identify the text that supports the inference, it is too much of a stretch.
- **Avoid absolute language.** Answers with "always," "never," "all," "none," or "only" are almost always wrong on inference questions unless the passage itself uses such language.
- **Stay within the passage's scope.** If the passage discusses one company, you cannot infer something about an entire industry.
- **Prefer moderate, qualified language.** Answers with "may," "some," "likely," "tends to," and "can" are more often correct because they make more conservative claims.

### How to Approach Inference Questions

1. **Identify the topic of the inference.** What is the question asking you to infer about?
2. **Locate the relevant passage content.** Use your passage map and keyword matching.
3. **Read the relevant section carefully.** Pay attention to qualifying language and implications.
4. **Test each answer choice against the passage.** Ask: "Is this supported by the passage, or does it go beyond what is stated?"
5. **Choose the answer with the strongest textual support** that still requires some inference (not just a restatement).

### Example: Inference Question

> *Passage excerpt: "While traditional publishing houses have seen declining revenues over the past decade, many independent authors who self-publish through digital platforms report earning more than they would have through traditional contracts. However, these successful self-published authors represent a small fraction of all self-published writers, and the vast majority earn less than $1,000 per year from their work."*

**Question:** It can be inferred from the passage that:

**(A)** Traditional publishing is no longer a viable business model.
**(B)** Most self-published authors cannot rely on their writing as a primary source of income.
**(C)** Digital platforms will eventually replace traditional publishing houses.
**(D)** Self-published authors are generally more talented than traditionally published authors.
**(E)** The quality of self-published books is inferior to that of traditionally published books.

**Answer: (B).** The passage states that "the vast majority earn less than $1,000 per year." Since $1,000 per year is far below what someone would need as a primary income source, we can infer that most self-published authors cannot rely on writing as their main income. This is a small, supported logical step.

**Why (A) is wrong:** "No longer viable" is too extreme. The passage says revenues are declining, not that the model has failed.
**Why (C) is wrong:** The passage does not discuss the future of the industry or make predictions.
**Why (D) and (E) are wrong:** The passage says nothing about talent or quality.

## Process of Elimination for RC

Process of elimination (POE) is especially powerful on RC questions because wrong answers tend to fall into predictable categories. Train yourself to recognize these:

### Wrong Answer Types

**1. Too Extreme**
The answer makes a claim that is stronger or more absolute than what the passage supports.

- Passage says: "Many scientists believe..."
- Wrong answer says: "All scientists agree that..."

**2. Opposite / Contradictory**
The answer states the reverse of what the passage says or implies.

- Passage says: "The new policy has had limited success..."
- Wrong answer says: "The new policy has been highly effective..."

**3. Out of Scope**
The answer introduces a concept, comparison, or claim not found anywhere in the passage.

- Passage discusses the economic impact of climate change.
- Wrong answer discusses the political implications of climate legislation.

**4. Distortion / Twisted Logic**
The answer takes real information from the passage but combines or reframes it in a misleading way.

- Passage says: "A causes B, and C causes D."
- Wrong answer says: "A causes D." (Mixing up the relationships.)

**5. Too Narrow (for Main Idea) or Too Broad (for Detail)**
The answer focuses on a detail when the question asks for a big-picture inference, or makes a sweeping claim when the question asks about something specific.

**6. Right Passage, Wrong Question**
The answer accurately describes something from the passage but does not answer the specific question being asked. Always check that the answer is responsive to the actual question.

## Practice Strategies

### Strategy 1: Categorize Wrong Answers

After completing practice RC questions, go back and label each wrong answer with its type (Too Extreme, Opposite, Out of Scope, Distortion, etc.). Over time, you will start to recognize these patterns instantly, which speeds up elimination.

### Strategy 2: The Textual Support Test

For every answer you consider selecting — especially on inference questions — ask yourself: "What specific part of the passage supports this?" If you cannot identify the supporting text, the answer is likely wrong. If you can identify it, verify that the answer does not overstate what the text says.

### Strategy 3: Predict Before You Look

Before reading the answer choices, formulate a rough prediction based on the passage. This is especially effective for detail questions where you can often identify the correct answer's content before seeing it in the choices.

### Strategy 4: Compare Final Contenders

If you have eliminated three answers but are stuck between two, compare them directly:

- Which one requires a smaller logical leap?
- Which one has stronger textual support?
- Does either one contain extreme language?
- Does either one go beyond the passage's scope?

The more conservative, better-supported answer is almost always correct.

## Example: Full Question Set

Consider this passage:

> *Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the ancient city of Cahokia, located near present-day St. Louis, may have had a population of 20,000 to 30,000 at its peak around 1100 CE — comparable to the population of London at the same time. The city featured a planned layout with a central plaza, massive earthen mounds, and a sophisticated system of wooden posts used for astronomical observations. Despite its impressive scale, Cahokia was abandoned by approximately 1400 CE. Researchers have proposed several explanations, including environmental degradation, political instability, and climate change, but no single theory has gained universal acceptance.*

**Detail Question:** According to the passage, Cahokia's population at its peak was:

**Answer:** Between 20,000 and 30,000 — directly stated in the passage.

**Inference Question:** It can be inferred that the abandonment of Cahokia:

**Answer:** Is not fully understood by modern researchers. (The passage says "no single theory has gained universal acceptance," implying that the cause remains a subject of debate and uncertainty.)

**Trap answer:** "Was primarily caused by climate change." (The passage lists climate change as one of several proposed explanations, not as the established cause.)

## GMAT Tips

- **Detail questions are "easy" points — do not rush them.** They require going back to the passage, but the answer is always there. Take 15 to 20 seconds to relocate the relevant text and verify before choosing.
- **Inference questions are not asking for your opinion.** Do not select an answer because it seems reasonable in the real world. Select it only if the passage provides logical support.
- **The correct inference is usually the most boring one.** It is the safe, conservative claim that is hard to dispute, not the exciting or surprising one.
- **Paraphrasing is your friend.** After reading the relevant passage section, rephrase the key idea in your own words. Then find the answer that matches your paraphrase.
- **Be suspicious of answer choices that use exact language from the passage.** On inference questions especially, test-makers sometimes use passage language to construct appealing but incorrect answers.
- **Do not spend more than 3 minutes on any single RC question.** If you are stuck, make your best elimination-based guess and move on. The time is better spent on other questions.
- **Train yourself to distinguish between "stated" and "inferred."** Some questions specifically ask what is stated (detail) vs. what is inferred. Mixing these up leads to selecting an answer that is technically correct for the wrong question type.
- **On "the author would most likely agree" questions,** focus on the author's perspective throughout the passage. These are inference questions about the author's views, not about objective facts.
