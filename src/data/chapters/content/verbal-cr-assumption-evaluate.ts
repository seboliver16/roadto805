# Critical Reasoning: Assumptions & Evaluate

Assumption and Evaluate questions test your ability to see beneath the surface of an argument. While Weaken and Strengthen questions ask you to find new information that changes the argument's force, **Assumption** questions require you to identify what the argument already takes for granted, and **Evaluate** questions ask you to determine what additional information would be most useful in assessing the argument. Mastering these question types will sharpen your logical thinking and earn you critical points on the GMAT.

## What Is an Assumption?

An **assumption** is an unstated premise that the argument depends on to be logically valid. It is a piece of reasoning that the author takes for granted — something that must be true for the conclusion to follow from the evidence, even though the author never explicitly says it.

Think of an assumption as a **hidden bridge** between the evidence and the conclusion. If you remove the bridge, the argument collapses.

**Example:**

> *All of the students in Professor Lee's advanced seminar received an A on the final exam. Therefore, Professor Lee must be an excellent teacher.*

- **Stated premise:** All seminar students received an A.
- **Conclusion:** Professor Lee is an excellent teacher.
- **Assumption:** Receiving an A on the final exam is a reliable indicator of teaching quality (as opposed to an easy exam, grade inflation, or highly motivated students).

## The Negation Test

The **Negation Test** is the single most powerful technique for verifying whether an answer choice is a necessary assumption. Here is how it works:

1. **Negate the answer choice** — flip it to its logical opposite.
2. **Ask yourself:** Does negating this choice destroy the argument?
3. If **yes**, the original answer choice is a necessary assumption.
4. If **no**, the original answer choice is not a necessary assumption.

**Example in action:**

> *Argument: The city's new bike-sharing program will reduce automobile traffic. The program will place 500 bikes at stations throughout the downtown area.*

Proposed assumption: *A significant number of downtown commuters will use the bike-sharing program instead of driving.*

**Negate it:** *Very few downtown commuters will use the bike-sharing program instead of driving.*

Does this destroy the argument? **Yes** — if nobody uses the bikes, traffic will not be reduced. Therefore, the original statement is a necessary assumption.

**Common pitfall with the Negation Test:** Be careful to negate precisely. "Some people will use bikes" negated is "No people will use bikes," NOT "Everyone will use bikes." Negation is about flipping truth value, not going to the opposite extreme.

## Necessary vs. Sufficient Assumptions

Understanding the distinction between necessary and sufficient assumptions is critical on the GMAT.

### Necessary Assumptions

A **necessary assumption** is something that **must be true** for the argument to hold. Without it, the argument falls apart. However, a necessary assumption alone does not guarantee the conclusion is true — it is a minimum requirement, not a guarantee.

- **Question stems:** "The argument above assumes which of the following?" or "The argument depends on which of the following assumptions?"
- **Characteristics:** Often modest in scope. They rule out a specific threat to the argument rather than proving the conclusion.

### Sufficient Assumptions

A **sufficient assumption** is something that, **if true, guarantees** the conclusion follows from the premises. It is a stronger claim that completely bridges the logical gap.

- **Question stems:** "Which of the following, if assumed, allows the conclusion to be properly drawn?" or "The conclusion follows logically if which of the following is assumed?"
- **Characteristics:** Often broader and more powerful than necessary assumptions. They may feel "too strong" but that is by design — they need to be strong enough to guarantee the conclusion.

**Key distinction:** Every sufficient assumption is also necessary, but not every necessary assumption is sufficient. On the GMAT, most assumption questions ask for **necessary** assumptions.

## Bridge Assumptions

A **bridge assumption** connects two concepts that appear in the argument but are never explicitly linked. This type of assumption is very common on the GMAT.

**How to spot them:** Look for a term or concept in the conclusion that is different from the terms used in the evidence. The assumption must connect these disparate ideas.

**Example:**

> *Studies show that children who eat breakfast perform better on standardized tests. Therefore, schools should provide free breakfast programs to improve academic achievement.*

- **Evidence term:** performance on standardized tests
- **Conclusion term:** academic achievement
- **Bridge assumption:** Standardized test performance is a good measure of (or is closely linked to) academic achievement.

There is also a second bridge here: the shift from "children who eat breakfast" (a general observation) to "schools providing breakfast" (a specific policy). The assumption is that school-provided breakfasts will have the same effect as breakfasts eaten at home.

**Strategy:** When reading an argument, always compare the language of the evidence to the language of the conclusion. If different concepts appear, a bridge assumption is almost certainly being tested.

## Defender Assumptions

A **defender assumption** does not introduce a new link but instead **rules out a potential threat** to the argument. It "defends" the argument against a specific objection.

**Example:**

> *The company's new remote-work policy will increase employee productivity, since employees will no longer waste time commuting.*

- **Potential threat:** Maybe working from home introduces new distractions (children, household chores, etc.) that offset the time saved from not commuting.
- **Defender assumption:** Working from home will not introduce distractions significant enough to offset the productivity gains from eliminating the commute.

Notice how the defender assumption does not prove the conclusion — it merely prevents one specific line of attack from sinking the argument.

**Strategy:** To find defender assumptions, ask yourself: "What could go wrong with this argument?" Then look for the answer choice that says "that thing does not happen."

## Evaluate Questions

### What They Ask

Evaluate questions ask you to identify a piece of information that would be most useful in **assessing** or **evaluating** the strength of the argument. The correct answer does not weaken or strengthen the argument by itself — instead, it identifies a question whose answer would determine whether the argument is strong or weak.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following would be most useful to know in evaluating the argument?"
- "The answer to which of the following questions would be most helpful in evaluating the argument above?"
- "Which of the following would it be most important to establish in order to evaluate the argument?"

### The Dual Outcome Test

The **Dual Outcome Test** is the definitive technique for evaluate questions. For each answer choice, ask:

- **If the answer is "yes," does it affect the argument?**
- **If the answer is "no," does it affect the argument?**

If **both** outcomes (yes and no) affect the argument — one strengthening and one weakening — then you have found the correct answer. If only one outcome matters, or if neither outcome matters, the choice is wrong.

**Example:**

> *Argument: A new pesticide is safe for use on food crops because laboratory tests showed it had no harmful effects on rats that consumed it for 30 days.*

Evaluate answer: *Whether the pesticide accumulates in body tissues over periods longer than 30 days.*

- **If yes (it does accumulate):** This weakens the argument — long-term exposure could be harmful even if 30-day exposure is not.
- **If no (it does not accumulate):** This strengthens the argument — the 30-day test is more likely to be representative of long-term safety.

Both outcomes are relevant, so this is a strong evaluate answer.

Contrast with: *Whether the pesticide is more expensive than alternatives.*

- This is irrelevant to whether the pesticide is safe. The argument is about safety, not cost. Neither a "yes" nor a "no" to this question affects the safety argument.

## Example Analysis

### Example 1: Necessary Assumption

> *Local wildlife authorities report that the population of deer in Greenfield County has doubled over the past decade. Since the number of hunting permits issued in the county has remained constant during this period, the increase in the deer population must be due to a decline in natural predators.*

**Conclusion:** The deer population increase is due to a decline in natural predators.

**Evidence:** The deer population doubled; hunting permits remained constant.

**Gap:** The argument eliminates one cause (hunting) and jumps to another (predator decline), but ignores other possible causes.

**Assumption:** There are no other significant factors (such as changes in food supply, habitat expansion, or reduced disease) that could explain the population increase.

**Negation Test:** If other significant factors could explain the population increase, the conclusion that predator decline is the cause falls apart. The negation destroys the argument, confirming this is a necessary assumption.

### Example 2: Sufficient Assumption

> *Anyone who has completed a certified financial planning course is qualified to advise clients on retirement savings. Rodrigo has been advising clients on retirement savings for five years. Therefore, Rodrigo has completed a certified financial planning course.*

**Conclusion:** Rodrigo has completed a certified financial planning course.

**Evidence:** He advises clients on retirement savings; completing the course qualifies one to advise.

**Gap:** The evidence tells us that completing the course is sufficient for being qualified, but the argument assumes it is the **only** way to be qualified.

**Sufficient assumption:** Only those who have completed a certified financial planning course are qualified to advise clients on retirement savings.

If this is true, and Rodrigo is advising clients (presumably he is qualified to do so), then he must have completed the course. The assumption guarantees the conclusion.

### Example 3: Evaluate

> *A city council is considering a proposal to convert a downtown parking lot into a public park. Proponents argue that the park will increase property values in the surrounding neighborhood, citing a study showing that properties within two blocks of urban parks sell for an average of 12% more than comparable properties farther away.*

**Conclusion:** The park will increase surrounding property values.

**Evidence:** Properties near urban parks sell for 12% more.

**Evaluate:** *Whether the 12% premium observed in the study is attributable to the parks themselves or to other features common to the neighborhoods where parks were built.*

- **If attributable to parks:** Strengthens the conclusion that building the park will increase values.
- **If attributable to other features:** Weakens the conclusion because the price premium may not carry over to this specific downtown location.

Both outcomes matter, making this an excellent evaluate answer.

### Example 4: Defender Assumption

> *The town's new ordinance requiring all restaurants to post calorie counts on their menus will lead to healthier eating habits among residents, since studies show that when people are aware of the calorie content of food, they tend to choose lower-calorie options.*

**Conclusion:** The ordinance will lead to healthier eating habits.

**Evidence:** People who are aware of calorie content choose lower-calorie options.

**Defender assumption:** Restaurant patrons will actually read and pay attention to the posted calorie information.

**Negation Test:** If patrons ignore the calorie postings entirely, the fact that calorie awareness influences food choices is irrelevant. The argument collapses. This is a necessary defender assumption.

## Common Wrong Answer Traps

- **Too Strong for a Necessary Assumption:** If a necessary assumption question has an answer that sounds like it would guarantee the conclusion, it is probably too strong. Necessary assumptions are often modest — they do not prove the conclusion, they just prevent it from collapsing.
- **Addresses the Wrong Gap:** Some answers identify a real assumption but one that is not central to the main logical gap. Always verify that the assumption connects the specific evidence to the specific conclusion.
- **Irrelevant Comparison:** As with weaken/strengthen questions, answers that introduce irrelevant comparisons are common distractors.
- **Confuses Necessary with Sufficient:** An answer that would be sufficient to prove the conclusion is not necessarily what a "necessary assumption" question is looking for, and vice versa.
- **For Evaluate: Only One Outcome Matters:** If an evaluate answer only affects the argument in one direction (only strengthens or only weakens regardless of the answer), it is not a true evaluate answer.

## GMAT Tips

- **Always apply the Negation Test** on assumption questions. It takes only a few seconds and dramatically increases accuracy. If negating a choice does not destroy the argument, eliminate it.
- **Watch for scope creep.** The correct assumption will precisely match the scope of the argument. If the argument is about a specific company, the assumption will be about that company — not about all companies in the industry.
- **Necessary assumptions are often underwhelming.** They do not prove the conclusion — they just prevent a specific way the argument could fail. Do not dismiss an answer because it seems "too obvious" or "too weak."
- **For evaluate questions, always test both outcomes.** Train yourself to ask: "What if yes? What if no?" If both answers affect the argument, you likely have the correct choice.
- **Do not confuse assumptions with evidence.** If a statement is explicitly made in the passage, it is not an assumption — it is a given premise.
- **Read the question stem carefully.** "Assumes" and "allows the conclusion to be properly drawn" signal different things (necessary vs. sufficient). Make sure you know which type of assumption is being asked for.
- **Bridge assumptions often hinge on a single word.** Pay close attention to shifts in terminology between the evidence and the conclusion — even subtle word changes can signal the gap the assumption must fill.
- **Time management:** Assumption and Evaluate questions can be deceptively tricky. Budget about 2 minutes, and if you are stuck between two choices, apply the Negation Test to both.
