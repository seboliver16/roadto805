# Critical Reasoning: Inference, Paradox & Structure

This chapter covers three important but less common Critical Reasoning question types: **Inference**, **Paradox (Resolve/Explain)**, and **Structure (including Boldface)**. While these appear less frequently than Weaken, Strengthen, or Assumption questions, they require distinct strategies and can catch unprepared test-takers off guard. Mastering these question types will give you a significant edge.

## Inference Questions

### What They Ask

Inference questions present a set of statements (not necessarily an argument with a conclusion) and ask you to identify what **must be true** or **can be properly concluded** based solely on the information given.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?"
- "If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?"
- "Which of the following conclusions is best supported by the information above?"
- "The statements above, if true, best support which of the following?"

### Key Principle: Stay Close to the Text

The most important rule for inference questions is to **stay as close to the text as possible**. A valid GMAT inference is not a wild leap — it is a small, logical step from what is directly stated.

- **Must be true:** The correct answer is something that must logically follow from the given information.
- **Avoid extremes:** Answers with absolute language ("all," "never," "always," "none") are almost always wrong unless the passage itself uses such language.
- **Beware of scope expansion:** If the passage discusses "some employees," the inference cannot be about "all employees."

### How to Approach Inference Questions

1. **Read the passage carefully.** Note specific facts, relationships, and any qualifying language (most, some, often, usually).
2. **Read each answer choice and test it against the passage.** Ask: "Does the passage require this to be true?"
3. **Eliminate answers that go too far.** If an answer adds information, makes a broader claim, or introduces a concept not in the passage, eliminate it.
4. **Choose the answer that is most directly supported.** The correct answer often feels "boring" or "obvious" because it sticks so closely to the text.

### Example: Inference

> *In the past five years, the number of organic farms in the Midwest has increased by 60%, while the total acreage devoted to organic farming has increased by only 20%. During the same period, consumer demand for organic produce has grown steadily.*

**What can be inferred?**

- The average size of Midwest organic farms has decreased over the past five years.

**Why this works:** If the number of farms increased by 60% but total acreage only increased by 20%, then mathematically, the average farm size must have gotten smaller. This is a strict logical consequence of the stated facts.

**Trap answers might include:**
- "Organic farming is more profitable than conventional farming." (Not supported — no information about profitability.)
- "Consumer demand has outpaced the supply of organic produce." (Too far — we know demand grew, but we do not know the relationship between supply and demand.)

## Paradox / Resolve / Explain Questions

### What They Ask

Paradox questions present two statements that seem to **contradict** each other and ask you to find the answer choice that **resolves** or **explains** the apparent contradiction. Both statements are treated as true — your job is not to dispute either one but to find information that makes both simultaneously plausible.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?"
- "Which of the following, if true, best explains the findings described above?"
- "Which of the following, if true, most helps to account for the difference described above?"

### How to Approach Paradox Questions

1. **Identify the two seemingly contradictory facts.** State them clearly to yourself.
2. **Ask: What could make both facts true at the same time?**
3. **Evaluate each answer choice.** The correct answer will provide a reason why the surprising result makes sense after all.
4. **Eliminate answers that only address one fact** or that deepen the paradox rather than resolving it.

### Example: Paradox

> *A company offered its employees a generous bonus for completing an advanced training course. Despite the financial incentive, the enrollment rate for the course actually decreased compared to the previous year, when no bonus was offered.*

**The paradox:** A bonus should increase enrollment, but enrollment decreased.

**Resolver:** *The company simultaneously changed its policy so that employees who failed the course would receive a negative performance review, and many employees were unsure they could pass the advanced material.*

**Why this works:** The fear of a negative review for failing outweighed the appeal of the bonus, explaining why fewer people enrolled despite the financial incentive. Both facts can now coexist logically.

### Example: Paradox

> *City X implemented a comprehensive recycling program last year. Although the total volume of recyclable materials collected increased by 30%, the amount of waste sent to landfills did not decrease.*

**The paradox:** More recycling should mean less landfill waste, but landfill waste stayed the same.

**Resolver:** *The total amount of waste generated by City X's residents increased significantly last year due to population growth and increased consumption.*

**Why this works:** Even though more material was recycled, total waste production grew enough to keep the landfill volume constant. Both facts are now explained.

## Boldface Questions

### What They Ask

Boldface questions present an argument with **one or two sentences in boldface** and ask you to identify the **logical role** each bolded statement plays in the argument.

Typical question stems include:

- "In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?"
- "The first boldface portion is ___ and the second boldface portion is ___."

### Common Roles

Each bolded statement will typically serve one of the following roles:

- **Main conclusion:** The author's primary claim.
- **Intermediate conclusion / sub-conclusion:** A claim that supports the main conclusion but is itself supported by other evidence.
- **Premise / evidence:** A fact or observation that supports a conclusion.
- **Counter-premise / opposing evidence:** A fact or claim that goes against the author's conclusion (often introduced with "however," "some argue," "critics contend").
- **Counter-conclusion / opposing position:** A conclusion drawn by someone the author disagrees with.
- **Background information:** Context that sets the scene but does not directly support or oppose the conclusion.

### How to Approach Boldface Questions

1. **Read the entire argument first.** Understand the overall flow before analyzing the boldface portions.
2. **Identify the author's main conclusion.** This is essential — without it, you cannot classify the bolded parts.
3. **Determine whether each bolded statement supports or opposes the author's conclusion.**
4. **Classify each bolded statement** using the roles listed above.
5. **Match your classification to the answer choices.** Eliminate any answer that misidentifies even one of the bolded statements.

### Example: Boldface

> *Some nutritionists claim that **a vegetarian diet provides all necessary nutrients for adult health**. However, recent research has shown that adults on vegetarian diets frequently have lower levels of vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids than non-vegetarians. **Therefore, while a vegetarian diet has many health benefits, it may need to be supplemented to be nutritionally complete.***

**First boldface:** This is a position that the author is arguing against — a **counter-conclusion** or opposing claim.

**Second boldface:** This is the **author's main conclusion**, which modifies the opposing claim by acknowledging benefits while arguing supplementation may be needed.

### Key Tips for Boldface

- **Do not confuse "premise" with "conclusion."** A premise is a supporting fact; a conclusion is a claim being argued for.
- **Watch for "opposing" vs. "supporting."** One of the most common errors is mixing up whether a bolded statement supports or opposes the author's position.
- **The author's conclusion often comes after words like "therefore," "thus," or "consequently."**
- **If two statements are bolded, determine the relationship between them.** Are they both on the same side? Or does one oppose the other?

## Complete-the-Passage Questions

### What They Ask

These questions present a passage with a blank (usually at the end) and ask you to select the answer choice that **logically completes** the author's reasoning.

Typical question stems include:

- "Which of the following most logically completes the argument below?"
- "Which of the following best completes the passage?"

### How to Approach

1. **Read the passage and identify the direction of the argument.** Is the author building toward a positive or negative conclusion? Is a contrast being set up?
2. **Pay close attention to transition words** just before the blank. Words like "therefore," "however," "thus," and "nevertheless" tell you whether the blank should agree with or oppose what came before.
3. **Predict what the blank should say.** The correct answer should follow logically from the preceding statements.
4. **Eliminate choices that contradict the passage's logic** or that introduce ideas not set up by the passage.

### Example: Complete the Passage

> *Although electric vehicles produce no direct emissions, the electricity used to charge them is often generated by burning fossil fuels. Therefore, the environmental benefit of switching to electric vehicles depends largely on __________.*

**Prediction:** Something about the source of electricity — whether the local power grid uses clean or fossil fuel-based energy.

**Completion:** *the energy mix of the electrical grid in the region where the vehicles are charged.*

**Why this works:** The passage sets up a tension between "no direct emissions" and "fossil fuels for electricity," so the logical conclusion is that the benefit depends on how the electricity is generated.

## Example Analysis

### Example 1: Inference with Numbers

> *Company A and Company B both sell widgets. Last year, Company A sold 10,000 widgets at $50 each, while Company B sold 8,000 widgets at $70 each. Company A spent $200,000 on advertising, while Company B spent $100,000.*

**Valid inference:** Company B generated more total revenue than Company A. (Company A: $500,000; Company B: $560,000.)

**Invalid inference:** "Company B is more profitable than Company A." (We do not know their costs beyond advertising.)

### Example 2: Paradox with Scientific Finding

> *A study of two groups of runners found that Group A, which stretched before every run, experienced a higher rate of muscle injuries than Group B, which did not stretch. Both groups ran the same distances at similar paces.*

**Paradox:** Stretching is supposed to prevent injuries, but the stretching group had more injuries.

**Resolver:** *Runners in Group A were, on average, 15 years older than runners in Group B and had a history of prior muscle injuries, which motivated them to stretch.*

**Why this works:** The groups were not comparable. The stretchers were older and more injury-prone to begin with, which explains both why they stretched and why they had more injuries. The paradox was caused by a confounding variable, not by stretching itself.

### Example 3: Boldface with Two Portions

> ***Sales of smartphones have plateaued in most developed markets over the past three years.** Some industry analysts predict that smartphone manufacturers will see declining revenues as a result. However, manufacturers have increasingly shifted their product mix toward premium models with higher profit margins. **It is therefore likely that leading smartphone manufacturers will maintain or increase their profitability despite flat unit sales.***

**First boldface:** Background information / premise that sets up the situation.

**Second boldface:** The author's main conclusion.

### Example 4: Complete the Passage

> *Researchers have found that bilingual children tend to outperform monolingual children on tasks requiring cognitive flexibility. However, this finding may not indicate that bilingualism itself improves cognitive flexibility, since __________.*

**Prediction:** There may be a confounding variable — something else about bilingual children that explains the difference.

**Completion:** *families that raise bilingual children may also engage in other cognitively enriching activities that contribute to the children's performance.*

## GMAT Tips

### For Inference Questions
- **Less is more.** The correct answer is almost always the most conservative, carefully worded choice. If it feels like a safe, modest claim, that is usually a good sign.
- **Test every word.** A single word like "all" instead of "some" can make an otherwise correct answer wrong.
- **The passage is your only source.** Do not bring in outside knowledge. Even if you know something is true in the real world, it is not a valid inference unless the passage supports it.

### For Paradox Questions
- **Both facts are true.** Do not pick an answer that disputes one of the stated facts.
- **The correct answer introduces new information.** Unlike inference questions (which stay within the passage), paradox answers bring in an outside fact that resolves the tension.
- **Eliminate answers that only explain one side.** The correct answer must account for the combination of both facts.

### For Boldface Questions
- **Identify the main conclusion first.** Everything else falls into place once you know the author's bottom line.
- **Use the answer choice structure to your advantage.** If you are certain about the role of one bolded portion, you can eliminate any answer that misidentifies it — even without being sure about the other portion.
- **Practice recognizing argument structures.** The more familiar you are with how arguments are built (premise, counter-premise, conclusion, counter-conclusion), the faster you will classify bolded statements.

### For Complete-the-Passage Questions
- **Transition words are your best friend.** The word immediately before the blank almost always tells you the direction of the correct answer.
- **The answer must flow naturally.** Read the entire passage with each answer choice inserted. The correct one should feel like a seamless continuation.

### General
- **Time management:** Inference and Paradox questions should take about 1.5 to 2 minutes. Boldface questions may take slightly longer because of the structural analysis required.
- **Read all five answer choices.** Even if you think you have found the correct answer early, confirm by checking the remaining options, especially on inference questions where the "best supported" answer might not be the first plausible one you see.
