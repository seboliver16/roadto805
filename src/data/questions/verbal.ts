const passageBusiness = `The concept of "first-mover advantage" has long been a staple of business strategy, suggesting that the first company to enter a market enjoys lasting benefits such as brand recognition, customer loyalty, and the ability to set industry standards. However, recent research has increasingly challenged this assumption. A comprehensive study of 500 product categories found that first movers failed at a rate of 47 percent, while "fast followers"—companies that entered the market shortly after the pioneer—failed at only 8 percent. Fast followers benefit from observing the pioneer's mistakes, refining the product based on initial consumer feedback, and entering the market when demand has already been validated. Moreover, first movers often bear the cost of educating consumers about a new product category, an investment from which later entrants benefit freely. The advantages traditionally attributed to first movers, such as switching costs and network effects, appear to be the exception rather than the rule. In most markets, the cost of pioneering exceeds the benefits, and sustainable competitive advantage derives not from market entry timing but from superior execution, continuous innovation, and the ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences. This finding has significant implications for corporate strategy: rather than racing to be first, companies may be better served by developing the organizational capabilities needed to move quickly once a market opportunity has been validated.`;

const passageScience = `The human gut microbiome—the complex community of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract—has emerged as a critical factor in human health that extends far beyond digestion. Recent research has revealed that gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), establishing a biochemical communication pathway between the gut and the brain known as the "gut-brain axis." Approximately 90 percent of the body's serotonin, a neurotransmitter central to mood regulation, is produced in the gut rather than the brain. Studies in germ-free mice—animals raised without any microorganisms—have demonstrated that the absence of gut bacteria leads to measurable changes in brain chemistry and behavior, including increased anxiety-like responses and impaired social development. When these mice are colonized with normal gut bacteria early in life, many of these behavioral abnormalities are reversed, but colonization later in life produces only partial recovery. This suggests that there exists a critical developmental window during which the microbiome shapes neural circuitry. Clinical studies in humans have found correlations between gut microbiome composition and conditions such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, and Parkinson's disease, though establishing causation remains challenging. The therapeutic potential is considerable: preliminary clinical trials of targeted probiotic interventions have shown modest but statistically significant improvements in symptoms of depression and anxiety, raising the possibility that future psychiatric treatments may include microbiome-based therapies alongside or instead of traditional pharmaceuticals.`;

const passageHistory = `The Bracero Program, a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico that operated from 1942 to 1964, brought approximately 4.6 million Mexican laborers to work temporarily on American farms and railroads. Initiated during World War II to address labor shortages caused by military conscription, the program was intended as a wartime emergency measure but was repeatedly extended due to pressure from agricultural interests. Under the program's terms, workers were guaranteed minimum wages, adequate housing, and return transportation to Mexico. In practice, however, these protections were frequently violated: workers often received substandard wages, lived in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and faced discrimination in the communities where they worked. The program had profound and contradictory effects on both nations. For Mexico, it provided an economic outlet for surplus rural labor and generated remittances that supported local economies, but it also contributed to a "brain drain" of productive workers from Mexican agriculture. For the United States, it supplied cheap labor that kept food prices low and agricultural profits high, but critics argued that it depressed wages for domestic farmworkers and created patterns of labor exploitation that persisted long after the program ended. The Bracero Program's legacy continues to shape contemporary debates about immigration policy, guest worker programs, and the rights of migrant laborers, serving as both a cautionary tale about the exploitation inherent in temporary labor schemes and a model for the potential benefits of regulated cross-border labor mobility.`;

const passageTechnology = `Quantum computing represents a fundamental departure from classical computing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that are theoretically impossible for traditional computers. Classical computers store information as bits, each of which can exist in one of two states: 0 or 1. Quantum computers, by contrast, use quantum bits, or "qubits," which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. When multiple qubits are entangled—a quantum phenomenon in which the state of one particle is intrinsically linked to the state of another—the computational capacity grows exponentially rather than linearly with each additional qubit. A quantum computer with just 300 fully stable qubits could theoretically represent more states simultaneously than there are atoms in the observable universe. However, the practical realization of quantum computing faces formidable obstacles. Qubits are extraordinarily fragile: even minor environmental disturbances, such as slight temperature fluctuations or stray electromagnetic fields, can cause "decoherence," destroying the quantum state and introducing errors. Current quantum computers require cooling to temperatures near absolute zero and extensive error-correction protocols that consume the majority of available qubits. As of now, no quantum computer has demonstrated "quantum advantage" on a commercially useful problem. Nevertheless, the potential applications—including drug discovery through molecular simulation, optimization of complex logistics networks, and the breaking of current encryption standards—have spurred billions of dollars in investment from both governments and private corporations, making quantum computing one of the most heavily funded areas of technological research worldwide.`;

const passageEnvironment = `Ocean acidification, often called "the other CO2 problem," is a direct chemical consequence of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide that poses a severe threat to marine ecosystems independent of climate change. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which dissociates to release hydrogen ions, thereby lowering the water's pH. Since the beginning of the industrial era, ocean surface pH has decreased by approximately 0.1 units, representing a 26 percent increase in acidity. While this may seem modest, the pH scale is logarithmic, and marine organisms are adapted to remarkably stable chemical conditions that have persisted for millions of years. The most immediate biological impact is on calcifying organisms—species that build shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate, including corals, mollusks, and certain plankton. As ocean pH decreases, the saturation state of calcium carbonate minerals declines, making it energetically more costly for these organisms to build and maintain their structures. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that under projected end-of-century pH conditions, many coral species show reduced calcification rates of 20 to 40 percent, and the shells of some pteropod species—small sea snails that form a critical base of polar food webs—begin to dissolve. The cascading ecological effects could be enormous: coral reefs support approximately 25 percent of all marine species, and pteropods are a primary food source for commercially important fish species such as salmon and herring. Unlike climate change, which can theoretically be addressed through carbon capture or solar radiation management, ocean acidification can only be mitigated by reducing CO2 emissions at their source.`;

const passageArts = `The Harlem Renaissance, which flourished from the early 1920s through the mid-1930s, was not merely a literary and artistic movement but a profound reimagining of African American identity in the wake of the Great Migration. As hundreds of thousands of Black Americans moved from the rural South to northern cities, Harlem became an intellectual and cultural capital where writers, musicians, visual artists, and scholars forged a new aesthetic that simultaneously celebrated African heritage and claimed a distinctly American voice. Writers such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston incorporated the rhythms and vernacular of Black folk traditions into their work, challenging the literary establishment's Eurocentric standards of artistic excellence. However, the movement was far from monolithic in its vision. A significant ideological tension existed between those who believed art should serve as a vehicle for political advocacy and racial uplift, and those who insisted that Black artists should be free to explore the full range of human experience without being constrained by the burden of representation. W.E.B. Du Bois, who championed art as propaganda, clashed with younger artists who resisted prescriptive expectations. This internal debate anticipated broader questions about the relationship between art and social justice that continue to resonate in contemporary cultural discourse. The Renaissance's impact extended beyond aesthetics: by demonstrating the richness and sophistication of African American intellectual life, it challenged the pseudoscientific racial hierarchies that had justified segregation and discrimination, laying cultural groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement that would follow decades later.`;

const passageEconomics = `The concept of "moral hazard" in economics describes a situation in which one party takes on excessive risk because another party bears the cost of that risk. Originally developed in the context of insurance—where policyholders might behave more recklessly because insurers cover their losses—the concept gained renewed prominence during the 2008 financial crisis. Critics argued that the government's decision to bail out large financial institutions created a moral hazard of unprecedented scale: if banks believed they would be rescued from the consequences of risky lending, they would have little incentive to exercise prudent risk management in the future. Proponents of the bailout countered that the alternative—allowing major banks to fail—would have triggered a catastrophic collapse of the entire financial system, imposing far greater costs on ordinary citizens who bore no responsibility for the crisis. This debate reveals a fundamental tension in economic policy between short-term stability and long-term incentive structures. Some economists have proposed that the moral hazard problem could be mitigated through stricter regulatory oversight, higher capital requirements, and mechanisms that impose losses on bank shareholders and executives before taxpayers. Others argue that moral hazard is an unavoidable feature of any financial system in which institutions are large enough that their failure threatens systemic stability, and that the most effective approach is to prevent institutions from becoming "too big to fail" in the first place. The resolution of this debate has significant implications for the design of financial regulation, the structure of the banking industry, and the allocation of risk between private actors and the public.`;

const passageLegal = `The doctrine of judicial review—the power of courts to invalidate legislation that conflicts with a constitution—is often regarded as a cornerstone of democratic governance, yet it presents a paradox that legal scholars have debated for centuries. In a democracy, the people's elected representatives make laws; judicial review allows unelected judges to override those laws. Critics argue that this "countermajoritarian difficulty," as legal scholar Alexander Bickel termed it, fundamentally undermines democratic self-governance by transferring ultimate legislative authority from accountable representatives to an insulated judiciary. Defenders of judicial review respond that democracy requires more than majority rule: it also demands the protection of individual rights and minority interests against potential tyranny by the majority. Without judicial review, legislatures could pass laws that violated fundamental freedoms, and citizens would have no institutional recourse. The practice of judicial review varies considerably across nations. In the United States, judicial review was established not by the Constitution's text but by the Supreme Court's 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison. In contrast, the United Kingdom historically operated under the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, which held that no court could overrule an Act of Parliament, though the adoption of the Human Rights Act in 1998 introduced a limited form of judicial oversight. Some nations, such as France and Germany, have established specialized constitutional courts separate from the ordinary judiciary to handle constitutional questions. Each model reflects different assumptions about the proper balance between democratic accountability and constitutional constraint, and no consensus has emerged on which approach best serves the dual goals of majority governance and minority protection.`;

const passageBiology = `Epigenetics—the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence—has fundamentally challenged the traditional view that genetic inheritance operates solely through the transmission of DNA from parent to offspring. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, can activate or silence genes without changing the genetic code itself. Environmental factors including diet, stress, and exposure to toxins can trigger epigenetic changes that alter an organism's phenotype, and some of these changes can be transmitted across generations. A landmark study demonstrated that mice exposed to a specific odor paired with an electric shock developed a heightened sensitivity to that odor, and remarkably, their offspring and even their grandoffspring exhibited the same sensitivity despite never having been exposed to the shock themselves. The mechanism involved epigenetic modifications to olfactory receptor genes in the sperm cells of the original mice. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of inheritance and evolution. Classical Darwinian evolution operates through random genetic mutations and natural selection over many generations, but epigenetic inheritance suggests that organisms can transmit acquired characteristics to their descendants far more rapidly. However, the significance of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans remains contested. While epidemiological studies have linked famine exposure in one generation to metabolic disorders in subsequent generations, isolating epigenetic mechanisms from confounding social and environmental factors in human populations presents formidable methodological challenges. The field continues to evolve rapidly, and its implications for medicine, agriculture, and evolutionary theory are only beginning to be understood.`;

const passageSocialScience = `The "bystander effect"—the phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help in an emergency when other people are present—was first systematically studied following the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City. Initial reports claimed that 38 witnesses observed the attack and none called police, though subsequent investigation revealed that this account was substantially exaggerated. Nevertheless, the case prompted social psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latane to conduct a series of experiments demonstrating that the presence of others genuinely inhibits helping behavior. In their classic 1968 study, participants who believed they were the sole witness to an apparent seizure offered help 85 percent of the time, while those who believed four other people were also aware of the emergency helped only 31 percent of the time. Darley and Latane proposed two primary mechanisms: diffusion of responsibility, in which individuals assume that someone else will intervene, and pluralistic ignorance, in which people look to others for cues about how to react and, seeing no one responding, conclude that the situation is not a true emergency. Subsequent research has refined these findings in important ways. Meta-analyses have shown that the bystander effect is weaker when the emergency is clearly dangerous rather than ambiguous, when bystanders are friends rather than strangers, and when the victim is perceived as a member of the bystander's social group. Some researchers have argued that the effect may be partially offset in real-world settings by the increased likelihood that at least one person in a larger group will have relevant training or personality traits that predispose them to act.`;

const passageLiterature = `The rise of the novel as a dominant literary form in eighteenth-century England was intimately connected to broader social and economic transformations. As a growing middle class gained both leisure time and literacy, demand surged for a literary form that reflected the experiences, concerns, and moral sensibilities of ordinary people rather than the aristocratic heroes of epic poetry and classical drama. Early novels such as Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Samuel Richardson's Pamela featured protagonists who were merchants, servants, and castaways—figures whose social positions and psychological complexities would have been considered unworthy of serious literary treatment in earlier eras. Literary scholar Ian Watt argued in his influential study The Rise of the Novel that the form's distinguishing feature was its commitment to "formal realism": a detailed, individualized representation of characters in specific times, places, and social circumstances. This emphasis on particularity distinguished the novel from the allegorical and typological modes of earlier prose fiction. However, Watt's thesis has been challenged by critics who note that it privileges a narrow canon of male English writers while ignoring earlier novelistic traditions in France, Spain, and Japan, as well as the significant contributions of women writers such as Aphra Behn and Eliza Haywood, who were producing innovative prose fiction well before Defoe. The debate over the novel's origins reflects broader methodological questions in literary history: whether literary forms emerge primarily from social and economic conditions, from the evolution of prior literary traditions, or from the creative innovations of individual authors.`;

const passagePhilosophy = `The philosophical concept of personal identity—what makes a person the same person over time—has generated sustained debate since John Locke's influential treatment in the seventeenth century. Locke argued that personal identity is grounded in psychological continuity, specifically in memory: a person at time T2 is the same person as at time T1 if and only if they can remember the experiences of the person at T1. This "memory criterion" had the radical implication that personal identity is independent of both bodily continuity and the persistence of an immaterial soul. Locke's theory faced immediate objections, most notably from Thomas Reid, who pointed out that it generates contradictions in cases of transitivity. If an elderly general can remember his deeds as a young officer, and the young officer can remember being flogged as a schoolboy, but the general cannot remember the flogging, then the general is both identical to and not identical to the schoolboy. Modern philosophers have attempted to rescue Locke's core insight by broadening the criterion from direct memory to overlapping chains of psychological connections, including memories, intentions, beliefs, and personality traits. Derek Parfit further challenged conventional thinking by arguing that personal identity is not what matters in survival; what matters is psychological continuity, which could theoretically branch or be realized in multiple individuals simultaneously. Parfit's thought experiments involving teleportation and brain duplication suggest that our ordinary concept of personal identity as an all-or-nothing relation may be fundamentally inadequate to describe the actual facts of human psychological life. The implications extend beyond metaphysics into ethics and law, where assumptions about persistent personal identity underpin concepts of moral responsibility, punishment, and promising.`;

    text: "Although migraine headaches are believed to be caused by food allergies, putting patients on diets that eliminate those foods to which the patients have been demonstrated to have allergic migraine reactions frequently does not stop headaches. Obviously, some other cause of migraine headaches besides food allergies must exist.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most weaken the conclusion above?",
    choices: [
      "Many common foods elicit an allergic response only after several days, making it very difficult to observe links between specific foods patients eat and headaches they develop.",

    explanation: "The argument concludes that some non-food-allergy cause must exist because elimination diets don't stop headaches. (A) weakens this by showing the diets may be incomplete: if allergic reactions are delayed by days, patients may not identify all trigger foods, so their elimination diets miss some allergens. The headaches continue not because of a different cause, but because the diets fail to eliminate all allergenic foods. (B) is about people without migraines — irrelevant.

The production managers therefore concluded that the new process did produce a cost savings.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, casts most doubt on the production managers' conclusion?",
    choices: [
      "In the cost reduction project that eventually led to the trial of the new process, production managers had initially been seeking cost reductions of fifty percent.",

    explanation: "The managers conclude the new process caused a 15% cost reduction. (C) reveals that a similar product made WITHOUT the new process also showed a 15% reduction during the same period.

At the end of the six-month trial, overall productivity as measured by output per employee had not decreased, and employee turnover dropped by 35 percent. The company's CEO argues that the four-day workweek should be adopted permanently because it improves employee retention without harming productivity.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthens the CEO's argument?",

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "The CEO argues that the four-day workweek improves retention without harming productivity. (C) strengthens this by quantifying the financial benefit of reduced turnover: since replacement costs are 150% of salary and turnover dropped 35%, the policy produces significant cost savings, making the case for permanent adoption stronger. (A) is about competitors and irrelevant. (B) eliminates confounds but does not strengthen the core claim. (D) actually weakens the argument by suggesting employees work the same total hours.

A medication for a condition that already has several effective treatments fails the second criterion. Therefore, it would not be eligible for expedited approval. (A) is not stated.
